Write a critique on a chart in published work (book/article/news website)\n\n\n\nData Visualization Retrieved from Flowingdata.com, posted on August 31, 2022\n\n\nThis visualization lacks elements on multiple fronts:\n\nA title is missing from the figure. Thereby, causing confusion as to what information is being relayed via the visualization.\nThere is no scaling information provided.\nThe lack of a legend or key, makes the colorization and color-coding confusing; leading to questions such as what do the colors dictate? Do the differences in colors have significance? I would assume that the colors is a way to divide the the United States; however, what is the division based on?\nThe figure does not yield a high informative power; that is, I am not really inferring much from the visualization.\n\nIn conclusion, while this visualization is certainly colorful and beautiful to look at, it does not convey information well; and therefore, does not serve the basic purpose of data visualization."
